# CSE Help Session to ICS

**Help Session to ICS** is a command-line tool that generates `.ics` calendar files for scheduling help sessions based on JSON input. Built with Rust, this tool simplifies calendar management for tutors.

## Features

- Parses JSON files with session details.
- Generates `.ics` files compatible with most calendar applications.
- Simple and easy-to-use command-line interface.

## Need to Update
- Change from reading JSON, which have to be manually created, to be able to pull JS code from Xavier's Website, and read JS instead.

## Installation
I'll change this later
